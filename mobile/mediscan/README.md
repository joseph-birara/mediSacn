## Requirements
Before setting up the app, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Flutter SDK**: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- **Dart SDK** (comes with Flutter)
- **Android Studio** or **Visual Studio Code** (with Flutter and Dart plugins)
- **Xcode** (for running on iOS)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/joseph-birara/mediSacn.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Mobile Folder
Change directory to the mobile folder:
```bash
cd mediSacn/mobile
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables
If your app requires environment variables (e.g., API keys), create a `.env` file and specify your variables. Make sure to include this file in your `.gitignore`.

### 5. TensorFlow Lite Model
Place the TensorFlow Lite model file (`model.tflite`) in the `assets` folder. Ensure your `pubspec.yaml` includes the asset:
```yaml
assets:
  - assets/model.tflite
```

## Running the Application

### 1. Start an Emulator or Connect a Device
- **For Android**: Use an Android Emulator or connect an Android device.
- **For iOS**: Use the iOS simulator or connect an iPhone.

### 2. Build and Run the App
To run the app on the connected device or emulator, use:
```bash
flutter run
```

## Folder Structure

The primary folders of interest are:

- **lib/**: Contains the source code.
  - **models/**: Data models like `Patient`, `LoginResponse`.
  - **services/**: Handles API and authentication logic.
  - **state/**: State management for various features.
  - **views/**: UI components such as login and registration screens.
- **assets/**: Includes the TensorFlow Lite model and other static assets.

## Key Features

- **Doctor Login**: Secure login for doctors using email and password.
- **Patient Registration**: Functionality to register patients with their details.
- **Diagnosis Integration**: Machine learning integration to detect conditions based on uploaded images.
- **API Communication**: Token-based authentication for secure API calls.

## Troubleshooting

- **Model File Not Found**: Ensure `model.tflite` is in the `assets` folder and correctly referenced in `pubspec.yaml`.
- **API Connection Issues**: Verify the API URL in the `AuthService`.
- **Flutter SDK Errors**: Update Flutter to the latest version using `flutter upgrade`.
